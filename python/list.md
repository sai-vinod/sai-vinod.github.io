Lists are one of the data structures in Python. Lists have certain properties
- Mutable & sliceable
- constant time complexity to retrieve stored value with index

You can define a new variable as list in below ways
```python
# Creating a python variable to hold list of numbers
var_list_num = [1, 2, 3]

# Creating a python variable to hold list of words
var_list_str = ["Creating", "a", "variable", "to", "hold", "list", "of", "words"]

# Creating a python variable to hold values of different data types
var_list_mix = [1, "a", 2.0, (3, "b)]
```
